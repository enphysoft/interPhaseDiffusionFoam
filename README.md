# interPhaseDiffusionFoam
This solver, interPhaseDiffusionFoam, is to solve solute diffusion phenomena in two-phase flow, especially air and water. Passive convection of solute transport is implemented using the basic algorithm of interFoam under the scope of the volume of the fluid (VOF) algorithm, and this new algorithm simulates solute diffusion more accurately at the air-water interface.
